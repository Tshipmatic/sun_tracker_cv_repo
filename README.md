# sun_tracker_cv_repo

In this repo I plan to design a cv model that track the sun.

## Plan

Data collection:
1. Take pictures of the sun then use Bing visual search and Google lense to get simirlay images.\\
  scripts needed:
    * Reverse image search in Bing and Google
    * Scrape jpg images from search [current]
